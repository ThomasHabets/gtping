 GTP Ping

   By Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.se> 2008-2010


Description
-----------
Like ping(8), but uses GTP ping requests to ping GGSNs and anything
else that will answer them.

Tested and works on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, IRIX and Solaris. Should
work on many more.

The Linux network code exposes more info about why a packet is
lost. Could be good to know.

GTP Specs at 3GPP:
  http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/2009-03/Rel-8/29_series/29060-870.zip
  http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/2009-03/Rel-8/29_series/29274-811.zip

3GPP don't seem to believe in preservation of history, so these links
are broken. But googling for these file names should give you a mirror.
This looks like yet another sign that it's *extremely* rare to find
a telco engineer who understands packet switching or the Internet.
