 GTP Ping

   By Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.pp.se>


Description
-----------
Like ping(8), but uses GTP ping requests to ping GGSNs and anything
else that will answer them.

Tested and works on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris. Should work on many more.

The Linux network code exposes more info about why a packet is
lost. Could be good to know.
