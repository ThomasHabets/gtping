Installing
==========
On debian systems I recommend creating a Debian package and installing
that. See below.

On other systems (or on debian if you like):

./configure
make
make install


Making a Debian package (optional)
==================================
./debian/rules binary


Making a release (maintainer only)
==================================
* up version in configure.ac
* debchange
* make mrproper
* autoreconf -i
* git commit
* make signed-dist
* debuild

System requirements
===================
I try to test it on at least these before doing a release:
* Debian GNU/Linux amd64
* Debian GNU/Linux x86
* OpenBSD amd64
* FreeBSD x86
* IRIX 6.5 mips
* Solaris 10 sparc

No special libraries are needed.
